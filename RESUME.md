### Description ( __TL; DR__ )
I'm a software developer, with almost 6 years of experience, and with a great deal of experience in Services Architecture, Web and Agile development. In all those years, my main domain experience was in Retail products (as in-house developer or consultant), but recently, I've been looking for new domain opportunities, such as fin tech or software development products.

As a consultant, I had the opportunity to work with the north America market for a few years. That kind of experience had a big impact in my career journey and technical knowledge.
As a product developer, I had the chance to apply Lean and Product software development techniques into the workflow. That helped to incorporate DevOps mindset, making use of a big tooling box into our development process. Continuous deployment was a day-to-day practice.

The main platform that I've worked with is Java. All the way from legacy systems to modern low latency microservices. However, I also had experience in smaller contexts to other platforms, like Node, Python, Groovy, Scala and Go.

Besides software platforms, I had experience and interest in some subjects, such as
API and Product Development, distributed systems, reactive architecture and services, data science (ML focused), DevOps culture (focused on CD), NoSQL and high throughput messaging systems (e.g Kafka), performance monitoring.

### Experience

I've started my carer with 17 years old, being an Internal on Hardware settings. After going thought high school, I finished a Java SE and EE course. At 18 I've started as a Junior Software Developer on Rio de Janeiro.

##### `B2W Digital` experience
Working mainly with high available and high throughput microservices development for a single Retail domain (promotions and discounts). I had the opportunity to learn and join a great collaborative culture, with a product mindset and ownership. In that kind of environment, I was able to touch Operations and Infrastructure sides, creating a trusted relationship and DevOps culture. We also used a lot of tooling in order to create a monitoring infrastructure and help Ops visibility. Also, NoSQLs usage was something very familiar for us. I was part of a great team, which excelled on building resilient products, dealing with crucial zero downtime applications, and exercising a lean software development culture. We also worked with state of the art technologies ( at the time ), such as `Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Functional Java, NoSQLs ( Mongo, Riak, ElasticSearch, Solr ), AWS, RESTful services`. I also had experiences dealing with Black Friday events and being a teacher for Internal developers.
