__Current Role__: Software Consultant  

### Description ( __TL; DR__ )
I'm a software developer, with 5 years of experience ( until Set/2016 ), working full time with web development and with a great deal of experience with Retail products.  
I've also worked as a Software Consultant ( since 2015 ) with USA Retail clients.  

My knowledge background is based on a bunch of on-line courses, an unfinished college, job experience and some open-source projects contributions.   
Also, I'm very interested in the following subjects:
 - Product and API development
 - Microservices, Distributed Systems and Reactive Architectures
 - Data Science, focusing on Machine Learning
 - DevOps/CD culture and mindset
 - NoSQLs and Messaging systems

### Experience

I've started my carer with 17 years old, being an Internal on Hardware settings. After going thought high school, I finished a Java SE and EE course. At 18 I've started as a Junior Software Developer on Rio de Janeiro.

- Internal at `Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)` (2011)
- Junior Software developer at `B2W Digital` (2012 - 2015)
- Software Consultant at `ThoughtWorks` (2015 - now )

##### `B2W Digital` experience
`B2W Digital` is the biggest on-line retail store on Latin America. There I was introduced to many new technologies and mindsets, such as distributed systems, agile culture, product development and so on. I was part of a great team, which excelled on building resilient products, dealing with crucial zero downtime applications, and exercising a lean software development culture. We also worked with state of the art technologies ( at the time ), such as `Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Functional Java, NoSQLs ( Mongo, Riak, ElasticSearch, Solr ), AWS, RESTful services`. I also had experiences dealing with Black Friday events and being a teacher for Internal developers.

##### `ThoughtWorks` experience
When I joined `ThoughtWorks` I had to change hats and start developing consultant skills.  Also, I had to exercise my English, so I could talk to USA clients without trouble.  
One of the things that I've started developing on `ThoughtWorks` was the Data Science skills. I have being working on this for quite some time, but without practical, job related experiences.
I also had in depth Continuous Deployment experience in one of our projects.
